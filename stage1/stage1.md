Project Title: Precipitation and Tucson Traffic Accident Frequency

## Stage 1: Accident Mapping
The first stage of the project will be the visualization of historical traffic accident data. The visualization will be in the form of a map of the City of Tucson showing the locations where traffic accidents occurred. The map can be filtered to show accidents by amount of precipitation, such as accidents that occurred at precipitation levels between 0 and 1 inches. 

The goal of this visualization is to show the areas where the most accidents are occurring. The filter will allow users to compare the accident hotspots when precipitation is and is not occurring.

The first stage is planned to be completed as a deliverable that can be presented at the VIP project showcase on March 23, 2024. 

## Possible challenges
- Rain often does not last for the entire day. How will accidents that occurred on a day with precipitation but not necessarily during the precipitation be handled?
- How will a large number of accidents in a small area be visualized? Color coding?

## Procedure
1. Data Acquisition
    - Get City of Tucson and NOAA datasets
    - Necessary info:
        - Accidents: Location, date, time
        - Weather: Precipitation levels, dates, times
